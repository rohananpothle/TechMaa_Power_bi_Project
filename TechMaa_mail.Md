 KPI Analytics & Live Performance Dashboard



Introduction:-

TechMaa IT Services operates with a remote-first workforce, consisting of interns and full-time employees working from distributed locations. Managing productivity, engagement, and performance in such an environment requires data-driven monitoring, real-time analytics, and intelligent reporting mechanisms.

This project focuses on building a Data Analytics System that processes workforce activity data and generates a Live KPI Dashboard. The dashboard provides insights into employee productivity, daily session participation, task performance, and intern revenue contributions—all in real time.

This project applies end-to-end data analytics techniques, including data collection, cleaning, processing, KPI modeling, visualization, and automated reporting.
